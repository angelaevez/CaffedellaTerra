# CaffedellaTerra

This is my first website coded from scratch. I used CSS Grid to organize my pages layouts and designed the logo in Procreate then refined it in Adobe Illustrator. What I found to be the most challenging aspect to this project was learning CSS Grid in two weeks time. After many tutorials and articles it finally clicked which was an awesome feeling. It also makes media queries that much more easy to define!
